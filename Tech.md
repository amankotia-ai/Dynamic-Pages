Tech Stack for Building a Clone of Unusual
To build a clone of Unusual—a tool that personalizes website content based on visitor sources, with Webflow as a use case for integration—you need a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly tech stack. Below is a detailed breakdown of the specific technologies required for each component (backend, client-side script, frontend UI, and infrastructure), including justifications and alternatives where applicable.
1. Backend (Server-Side System)
The backend handles user authentication, source management, rule-based personalization logic, and content delivery via API endpoints.
Core Technologies
Node.js (v20.x.x)  
Purpose: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
Why: Fast, non-blocking I/O model suits real-time content delivery; aligns with JavaScript used in the client-side script; large ecosystem via npm.
Specifics: Use LTS version (e.g., 20.11.0 as of March 2025) for stability and long-term support.
Installation: nvm install 20 && nvm use 20.
Express.js (v4.18.x)  
Purpose: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Why: Lightweight, flexible, and widely used with Node.js; simplifies routing and middleware setup for endpoints like /get_content.
Specifics: Latest stable version ensures compatibility with modern Node.js.
Installation: npm install express.
MongoDB (v7.x.x)  
Purpose: NoSQL database for storing user data and personalization sources.
Why: Flexible schema supports JSON-like documents (e.g., sources with nested replacements); scales well for unstructured data like content variations.
Specifics: Use MongoDB Community Server locally or MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted) with a free M0 tier (512MB storage) for initial development.
Installation: Local: brew install mongodb-community (Mac) or equivalent; Cloud: Sign up at MongoDB Atlas.
Mongoose (v8.x.x)  
Purpose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
Why: Simplifies schema definition, validation, and querying for Users and Sources collections; provides type safety and middleware.
Specifics: Latest version ensures compatibility with MongoDB 7.x.x.
Installation: npm install mongoose.
Security and Authentication
bcrypt (v5.1.x)  
Purpose: Password hashing library.
Why: Securely hashes user passwords with a salt; industry standard for password storage.
Specifics: Use with a work factor of 10-12 for balance between security and performance.
Installation: npm install bcrypt.
jsonwebtoken (v9.0.x)  
Purpose: JWT library for user authentication.
Why: Generates and verifies tokens for secure API access; stateless and scalable.
Specifics: Use HS256 algorithm with a strong secret stored in .env.
Installation: npm install jsonwebtoken.
sanitize-html (v2.13.x)  
Purpose: Sanitizes HTML content to prevent XSS attacks.
Why: Ensures user-provided content (e.g., replacements) is safe to inject into the DOM.
Specifics: Configure to allow basic HTML tags (e.g., <p>, <strong>) while stripping scripts.
Installation: npm install sanitize-html.
Performance
memory-cache (v0.2.x)  
Purpose: In-memory caching for frequent queries.
Why: Speeds up /get_content responses by caching sources per user_id; lightweight for an MVP.
Specifics: Use with a 5-minute TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries.
Installation: npm install memory-cache.
Environment Management
dotenv (v16.4.x)  
Purpose: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
Why: Keeps sensitive data (e.g., database URI, JWT secret) out of codebase; standard practice.
Specifics: Define PORT, MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET in .env.
Installation: npm install dotenv.
Alternatives
PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB: If structured data and relational queries become critical (less likely for this use case).
Fastify instead of Express.js: For higher performance in high-traffic scenarios, though less beginner-friendly.
2. Client-Side Script
The script integrates with websites (e.g., Webflow) to fetch and apply personalized content dynamically.
Core Technologies
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
Purpose: Core language for the script.
Why: No dependencies required; runs natively in browsers; compatible with Webflow’s static HTML output.
Specifics: Use modern features like fetch, async/await, and arrow functions for concise code.
Tools: Write in a .js file (e.g., unusual.js).
Fetch API  
Purpose: Makes HTTP requests to the backend.
Why: Built into modern browsers; no external libraries needed; supports JSON natively.
Specifics: Use POST requests to /get_content with JSON payloads.
Build Tools
UglifyJS (v3.17.x)  
Purpose: Minifies JavaScript for production.
Why: Reduces file size for faster loading on client sites; essential for a script served via CDN.
Specifics: Run uglifyjs unusual.js -o unusual.min.js to generate minified version.
Installation: npm install uglify-js -g.
Alternatives
Axios instead of Fetch: For more robust HTTP handling (e.g., automatic JSON parsing), but adds ~20KB to script size, less ideal for a lightweight integration.
3. Frontend (User Interface)
The dashboard allows users to manage sources, authenticate, and generate the script.
Core Technologies
React (v18.x.x)  
Purpose: JavaScript library for building the UI.
Why: Component-based architecture speeds up development; large community and ecosystem; ideal for dynamic dashboards.
Specifics: Use latest stable version; scaffold with create-react-app.
Installation: npx create-react-app client --template typescript (optional TypeScript for type safety).
React Router (v6.22.x)  
Purpose: Client-side routing for navigation.
Why: Enables pages like login, dashboard, and script generator without full reloads.
Specifics: Use <BrowserRouter> and <Route> components.
Installation: npm install react-router-dom.
Axios (v1.6.x)  
Purpose: HTTP client for API calls from the frontend.
Why: Simplifies requests with automatic JSON parsing and error handling; better than Fetch for UI complexity.
Specifics: Use for CRUD operations on /sources.
Installation: npm install axios.
Styling
Tailwind CSS (v3.4.x)  
Purpose: Utility-first CSS framework.
Why: Rapid, responsive styling with minimal custom CSS; aligns with modern UI trends.
Specifics: Integrate via PostCSS in React setup; configure in tailwind.config.js.
Installation: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer && npx tailwindcss init -p.
State Management
React Context API  
Purpose: Manages global state (e.g., user authentication).
Why: Built into React; sufficient for an MVP without external library overhead.
Specifics: Use for storing JWT and user data post-login.
Alternatives
Vue.js instead of React: Lighter and simpler for smaller teams, but less ecosystem support.
Chakra UI instead of Tailwind: For pre-built components, though adds more weight.
4. Infrastructure and Deployment
The infrastructure supports hosting, scaling, and development workflows.
Hosting
AWS EC2 (t2.micro)  
Purpose: Hosts the Node.js backend.
Why: Free tier available (1 year); scalable with load balancers if needed; full control over server.
Specifics: Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS; install Node.js and PM2 for process management.
Cost: ~$0 initially, ~$13/month post-free tier.
AWS S3 + CloudFront  
Purpose: Hosts and delivers unusual.js.
Why: S3 for static file storage; CloudFront CDN for low-latency global delivery, critical for script performance.
